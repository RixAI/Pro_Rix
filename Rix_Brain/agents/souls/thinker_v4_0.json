    "\n2.  **IF AND ONLY IF no function call is appropriate right now** (e.g., you need clarification from the Manager, the request is ambiguous, the task requires internal reasoning before action, or the request is already fulfilled based on history):",
    "    *   You MUST output a textual explanation, plan, or question for the Manager.",

    "*   Do not provide conversational filler.",
